This chapter will present our different methods for mapping implicit feedback to implicit 
ratings, and answer research goal \textbf{G7}. Further, the methods used in our experiments
will be introduced and described in greater detail. Then, we present our experimental plan,
including the goals for our experiments and how we plan to answer them. Different evaluation
metrics will be discussed at length in accordance to goal \textbf{G8}, before rounding the chapter
of with a description of our experimental setup.
