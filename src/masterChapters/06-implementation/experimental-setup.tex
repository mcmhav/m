\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Computer Specifications}

The experiments are run on a Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit
machine with an Intel Core i7 920 CPU and 12GB of ram.

\subsection{Parameter Settings}

%Parameter settings for our fancy algorithms

In k-NN item-item models, the number of neighbors 
generally increases system performance (Bell et al., 2007a, 2007b). However, the quadratic 
complexity of the search for k-NN, whether in time or space, is quadratic. So there's always a 
tradeoff for an industrial system \cite{Deshpande2004, Cremonesi2010} to select a 
reasonable value for K. Moreover, many recent studies are limited to a few tens of items for their 
neighborhood model (Bell et al, 2007c) (Takacs et al., 2007). So we use a number of nearest 
neighbors of K=200 for all tests, to have good security effectiveness.
