\chapter{The SoBazaar Data}
\label{chap:thesobazaardata}
\minitoc

    This sections will introduce the SoBazaar application and present and explore the data set used.
    This includes how the data was preprocessed, an overview of the dataset, statistics and graphs, findings from the data and finally a summary.

    The motivation for doing this is to lay ground for the assumptions made throughout this thesis, and help to more effortlessly present the reasoning behind the choices made, in regards to the fashion domain, the usage of implicit feedback and the recommender systems used.

	\section{The SoBazaar Application}\mbox{}\\
  \label{sec:sobazaar-data}

	\begin{chapquote}[30pt]{About SoBazaar}
	  "SOBAZAAR is a newly developed social shopping experience --- a daily fashion bazaar on your mobile."
	\end{chapquote}

	SoBazaar is an online marketplace for fashion, but with a social twist. You can find stores like Moods of Norway, BIK BOK, Bianco and many more, which all have their own storefront in the application. The application lets you browse through thousands of products. If you find something you like you can purchase it directly from the application or store it for later with the \emph{heart it} function. The following screenshots are taken from the application and highlights some functionality currently found in the application. On the far left you see a newsfeed item from the \emph{homepage} or newsfeed. The newsfeed currently shows what other users have liked, notifies the user about sales and new products and recommends the most popular products.

	From the product screen you can choose to buy items, by being redirected to the stores online webshop. The product screen currently features a \emph{People who like this also love} widget, and also shows other products from the same store. The application also features your own personal page for your saved or \emph{loved} items. In additional the application
	also supports simple search queries.

	The application is currently in a beta phase and is planned for a final release after the summer.

\section{Preprocessing}
    \label{sec:preprocessing}
    In data mining, preprocessing is an important part, which creates the foundation for the data analysation and for further down the pipeline.
    The saying \emph{garbage in, garbage out}~\cite{GIGO} especially applies here, where the input data can make or break the results since all the raw values are seldom complete in regards to information and sense, and some will not make sense to consider. %, such as: \emph{gender:male}, \emph{pregnant:true}.

    The data from SoBazaar has been been anonymised for privacy reasons.
    In addition to anonymization the data was cleaned by removing events containing test environment flags and applications run from simulator.
    What was left after the cleaning data was mainly events triggered by the users in production environment, and not created during applications testing.

    As part of the preprocessing, an extra field was added to the data, a session field.
    This field was added to help understand how users use the application, and to be able to see usage patterns.

\section{Dataset Overview}
    The data from SoBazaar is based on the actions of the users, stored in logs, which are saved whenever a user executes an action the system has the ability to log.
    Actions done by the users are called events, such as accessing a store, scrolling a page or purchasing a product, all these events put together is the dataset used in this thesis.

    When an event is triggered a set of information is stored regarding the event.
    This data is used to make recommendations for the users trough converting the implicit feedback to implicit ratings as we will see in later chapters.
    Some of the most relevant metadata to making recommendations are presented in the table below.

    \begin{table}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{l p{11cm}}
            \toprule
            Variable     & Explanation   \\
            \midrule
            \emph{product\_id}      & The id of the item which triggered the event \\
            \emph{user\_id}      & The unique id of the user who triggered the event \\
            \emph{event\_id}         & What kind of event was triggered~\tablefootnote{Complete list of the different types of events can be found in table~\ref{table:events}} \\
            \emph{price}             & The price of the item which triggered the event \\
            \emph{retailer\_brand}   & The id of the retailer brands. A retailer is a distributer of products, such as H\&M, Cubus or Moods Of Norway \\
            \emph{storefront\_id}    & The storefront id of the storefront entered. The \emph{retailer\_brand}s can have multiple \emph{store\_front}s. In addition to the main \emph{store\_front} most \emph{retailer\_brands} have, they can also add one or more when there is a special occasion such as a sale or a new release \\
            \emph{event\_location}   & The location of the user when the event was triggered \\
            \emph{ts}                & Unix timestamp in milliseconds of when the event was triggered \\
            \emph{session}           & Which session number the event belongs to~\tablefootnote{This is the value added in the preprocessing phase~\ref{sec:preprocessing}. For two events to end up in the same session, the event has to be triggered within a certain period of time, and both be after the same application started-flag} \\
            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
        \caption[Event Metadata]{Metadata collected from an event. The complete list can be found in table~\ref{table:completeEventData}}
        \label{table:eventData}
    \end{table}

    In the table above we see some of the more relevant attributes to an event triggered.
    These can be used to derive information regarding the users of the application and the items, and put together, be used to predict preferences for the users.

    After gathering the data and preprocessing it, on single set of data was left.
    The statistics of this data is shown in the table below, and is there to present a birds view of the data used in this thesis.

        \caption[Dataset summary]{Overview of the key figures in the SoBazaar dataset}
        \label{table:datasetSummary}
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

    As seen from table~\ref{table:datasetSummary} the average amount of \emph{purchases} per user are below one. Using purchase information alone to make recommendations will therefore in most cases render the recommendations incomplete. If one or more users have more than one purchases, then some users will of course have none purchases. Making personalized recommendations for these users will then be unattainable.

    \emph{Clicks} and \emph{wants} on the other hand have a much higher occurrence. These two events together with \emph{purchases} tops a count of 20 on average per user, and opens for the possibility of more dense personalized recommendations, but the data is still rather sparse.

    This section will look at the SoBazaar data through visualizing the data and clearly communicating the information trough graphical means.
    It will start with the properties of the users seen in the data, then move over to the products and finally the time properties of the data.

\subsection{User properties}
    The properties of the users of the SoBazaar application can help understand how the application is used, and to get a better understanding of how to make predictions for them.

    The first figure visualizing the user behavior is a figure of the event distribution, and shows the events the users are triggering, and to what extend they do so.
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=5in]{image/event_iddistribution.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Event distribution}
    \label{figure:eventIDDistribution}
    \end{figure}
        In the figure above (figure~\ref{figure:eventIDDistribution}) we see the count for each of the different events which can be triggered in the SoBazaar application\footnote{With the exception of the event types with a trigger count lower than 200, which are merged into on bar and labeled \emph{other}}.
        As seen from the graph the \emph{product\_detail\_clicked}-event and the \emph{storefront\_clicked}-event are the two most common events to be triggered.
        As mentioned earlier in~\ref{table:eventData}, the \emph{storefront} is the main access point to a set of products, and the high values for this \emph{event\_id} is as expected.
        The fact that accessing the \emph{storefront} is the most occurring event, over clicking an item, indicates that many users browse the items through looking at the thumbnails rather than accessing the actual item.

        The \emph{product\_wanted}-event is the fourth most occurring event, and is about half the size of the \emph{product\_detail\_clicked}-event, this does not imply that half of the users accessing an item also adds the accessed item to their want list, since it is possible to want an item without accessing the item.
        \emph{product\_purchase\_intended} on the other hand has to come after a \emph{product\_detail\_clicked}, so it is therefore safe to assume that about 8\% of item accesses progressed into an intended purchase.

        Some of the evens shown above are newly added events, and the data has to mature more for more certain conclusion to be drawn.

        The distribution of events for the users are show in the next figure, and is intended to give a better overview of to what extent the users interact with the applications, and how the usage is distributed amongst the users.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\dualGraphWidth]{image/user_iddistribution.png}
            \caption{Distribution of events on users}
    \label{figure:userEventDist}
        \end{subfigure}%
        \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\dualGraphWidth]{image/user_idcumdistribution.png}
            \caption{Cumulative distribution of events on users}
    \label{figure:userEventCumDist}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Graphs presenting the distribution of events per user}
    \end{figure}
        Figure~\ref{figure:userEventDist} is showing the actual amount of users with the different counts of events.
        78\% of the users have 50 or less events, with the mean being at 5 events.
        The figures are showing the values from 0 to 250 since 96\% of the users resides in this subset of the data.

        As seen from figure~\ref{figure:eventIDDistribution} most of the events are not directly related to products, from table~\ref{table:datasetSummary} we can see that there are over 6000 products, and as mentioned above, 78\% of the users have less than 50 events. Based on these three facts, we can assume that the data is extremely sparse and measures to deal with this must be implemented.

        The distribution of events on the users tells us how the users interact with the applications, and how the events are distributed, but events are all actions taken by the users, and some of these might not be interesting when making recommendations for the users.
        A reduced view of the one seen in the figures above are shown in the figures below, where the only events considered are item interaction events.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[width=\dualGraphWidth]{image/ratingsPerUserdistribution.png}
            \centering
            \caption{Count of item interactions for users}
    \label{figure:ratingsPerUser}
        \end{subfigure}%
        \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[width=\dualGraphWidth]{image/ratingsPerUsercumdistribution.png}
            \centering
            \caption{Cumulative count of item interactions for users}
    \label{figure:ratingsPerUserCum}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Figures presenting the number of product interactions for the users in the data}
    \end{figure}
        In the figures above the rightmost bar present 0 product interactions.
        The graphs are limited to only showing interaction amounts up till 60 to give focus to the numbers where more than 90\% of the users resides.

        As seen from figure~\ref{figure:ratingsPerUserCum}, over 20\% of the users have never interacted with an item, and about 10\% of the users have more than 50 item interactions.

        Even though the data is sparse, as seen from the previous figures, the fact that the majority of the users have in some way interacted with at least one item, opens for the possibility of connecting users based on their item interactions.

        Now that we have looked at the distribution of events both as a whole, and as a reduced view, we might benefit from looking at how often the users use the application. The figure below shows the number of sessions for the users.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=5in]{image/sessiondistribution.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Distribution of sessions for users}
    \label{figure:sessCountDist}
    \end{figure}
        The figure above shows the count of sessions for the users of the SoBazaar application, with the users with more than 30 sessions removed.

        More than 90\% of the users of SoBazaar have a session count of 20 and less.
        This means that they have not logged on to the applications more than 20 separate times, over the time the data was collected, and strengthens the hypothesis that the data from SoBazaar is sparse.

        In figure~\ref{figure:sessCountDist} the 4 first bars sums up to 1000, which is the amount of users who has had 4 or less sessions on the application in total. In other words --- half of the users used the application less than 4 times.

        After having looked at the usage distribution of the users , we move over to the user account lifetime, to see actually how long a user is active on the application in terms of time from first to last recorded event for the user.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=5in]{image/userTimespansdistribution.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Distribution of user account lifetime}
    \label{figure:userTimespandist}
    \end{figure}
        The figure above displays the lifetime of the user accounts in the application in weeks, where the lifetime is measured from the first occurrence of the unique user id till the last event triggered by that user.

        From this figure it is apparent that over half of the user accounts have a lifespan of less than a week.

        Lifetime of the accounts mapped together with their usage might tell us more than just the account life time alone, so the next figure displays just that.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=5in]{image/avglifetimeoncountuser.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Average lifetime of user accounts sorted on event count}
    \label{figure:avglifetimeoncountuser}
    \end{figure}
        The figure above shows the lifetime of the user accounts together with their application interaction count.
        Users more to the right have a higher event count.
        Some outliers have been removed to give focus to the majority of the users. As mentioned earlier, 78\% of the users have triggered 50 or less events.

        The red line is the regression line of the user account lifetimes, and is there to show how the account life span increases with the amount of events.

        As seen in the data set overview table~\ref{table:eventData}, the location of the user at event trigger is stored in the data. The locations of the users are shown in the figure below.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=5in]{image/simpleGeoPlotNorway.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Plot of event location in and around Norway}
    \label{figure:croppedGeoplot}
    \end{figure}
        Figure~\ref{figure:croppedGeoplot} shows the location of the user at the time the different events was triggered.
        It is cropped to show events triggered in and around Norway.
        We can see that the majority of the users are located in and around the capital city of Norway, Oslo.

        If the event is triggered from a phone, the event is as precise as the GPS hardware location of the phone, and would be helpful information to understand more about the user.

\subsection{Product properties}
    The properties of the products can tell help to tell how the products are being interacted with, and the distribution of events on them.

    The next two figures presents the distribution of price of the products in the database.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[width=\dualGraphWidth]{image/priceDistributiondistribution.png}
            \centering
            \caption{Price distribution of products}
    \label{figure:pricePerProduct}
        \end{subfigure}%
        \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[width=\dualGraphWidth]{image/cumpriceDistributiondistribution.png}
            \centering
            \caption{Cumulative price distribution of products}
    \label{figure:pricePerProductCum}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Figures presenting the distribution of price for the items i SoBazaar}
    \end{figure}
        Here we see how the products are distributed in regards to their price.
        134 of the products have a price over 2 500 NOK and have been left out of this graph.

        The price range of the application varies a lot, but 82\% of the items have a price lower than 1 000 NOK.

        Next figures up are two ways of presenting the distribution of events on the items in the dataset.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[width=\dualGraphWidth]{image/product_iddistribution.png}
            \centering
            \caption{Count of events on products}
    \label{figure:eventsPerproduct}
        \end{subfigure}%
        \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[width=\dualGraphWidth]{image/product_idcumdistribution.png}
            \centering
            \caption{Cumulative count of events on products}
    \label{figure:eventsPerproductCum}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Figures presenting the distribution of events for the products i SoBazaar}
    \end{figure}
        80\% of the products only have an interaction count of 10 or less, where interaction count is \emph{product\_detail\_clicked}, \emph{product\_wanted} and \emph{product\_purchase\_intended}.
        This means that there will not be more than 10 events for the majority of the items, with no more than 10 datapoints to connect with other items for the majority of the items, recommendations done through connecting items to other items through item interaction, might prove problematic.

        When the majority of the events only has 10 events and there are over 6 000 items and 2 000 users, the probability that multiple users have interacted with similar items will be marginal, but promotes the importance of utilizing all the feedback to bolster the recommender.

\subsubsection{The Pareto principle and Long tail on sales}
    In e-commerce the distribution of sales or product interactions can often be described by the Pareto principle and the phenomenon of long tail.
    Pareto's principle is used to tell how the distribution is in the \emph{head}~\footnote{Take for example figure~\ref{figure:eventsPerproduct}, the \emph{head} is the left most part where the curve is steep} of the graph, and the long tail phenomenon is used to tell how the distribution is in the \emph{tail}~\footnote{Take for example figure~\ref{figure:eventsPerproduct}, the \emph{tail} is the right most part where the curve flattens out} of the graph.

\paragraph{Pareto's Principle}
    Pareto's principle applies when the 20\% most frequent products account for more than 80\% of the ratings, sales or interactions in the dataset~\cite{newman05power}.

    \begin{table}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{lll}
        \toprule
        Threshold &   Products in threshold~\tablefootnote{\label{footnote:pt}The amount of products residing within the percentage threshold} &      Percentage of interactions \\

        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Pareto's principle values}
    \label{table:paretosPrinciple}
    \end{table}

    Figure~\ref{figure:paretosPrinciple} show the percentages of interactions within the given thresholds.
    As we can see from table~\ref{table:paretosPrinciple}, the 20\% most frequently interacted with items represents 59.1701\% of the item interaction in total.
    We have to move up to 41\% to reach 80\% of the interactions, and the Pareto's principle does therefore not apply to the SoBazaar dataset.

    Even though Pareto's Principle does not apply to this data, is the information regarding where the majority (the 80\%) of the item interaction resides valuable.
    To reach the majority of the item interaction we have to cover over 41\% of the most popular items, which might in turn lead to bad most popular results.

\paragraph{Long Tail}
    The definition of long tail is that the most frequently-occurring items represent less than 50\% of occurrences in logs~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1203-4487}.

    \begin{table}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{llll}
        \toprule
        Average product interaction   & Products in threshold~\tablefootnote{See footnote~\ref{footnote:pt}} & Coverage & Percentage of interactions \\
        \midrule
        6.6928   &    4194   & 68.8443\% &   28.5408\% \\
        \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Long tail values}
    \label{table:longtail}
    \end{table}

    As the table above shows the SoBazaar data does not posses a clear long tail behavior.
    The average interaction count of the products is 6.6928 and there is 4194 products with less than this number of interactions, but these items does only cover 28.5408\% of the total interactions.

    The next figure displays an overview of which events are triggered on the \emph{storefronts} in the SoBazaar application.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=5in]{image/storefront_nameandEventdistribution.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Distribution of events on storefronts}
    \label{figure:eventOnStoreFrontDist}
    \end{figure}
        The figure above presents the event distribution on the different storefronts.
        The events are segmented to show the different event counts on the different storefronts, and stacked to show the complete count, to be able to clearly see how the events are distributed over the different stores.
        We can see that \emph{H\&M} is the most popular store in total, but \emph{BIK BOK} has the most \emph{product\_purchase\_intended}-events.
        One interesting find to take from this graph is the \emph{storefront\_clicked} to the item interaction related events (\emph{product\_detail\_clicked}, \emph{product\_wanted} and \emph{product\_purchase\_intended}) ratio.
        For instance \emph{Bik Bok} has a much higher item interaction count than storefront access count, whereas stores such as \emph{Reiss} and \emph{Inwear} are mostly accessed and the items not interacted with.
        Different aspects affecting this might be price, style and item presentation.

\subsection{Time properties}
    It is not only important to look at if a user has accessed an item, or if a user has a certain preference, time might also tell something about the preferences of the user.

    The next figure shows the average lifetime of the products in the SoBazaar database.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=5in]{image/itemTimespansdistribution.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Count of the different time spans of the items}
    \label{figure:itemLifes}
    \end{figure}
        This figure shows the count of products which has the different time spans.
        This figure makes it clearer than figure~\ref{figure:itemTimeSpanEventCount} how long the majority of the the products have lived.

        Almost 2 500 products have a life span of less than a week, which shows how important it is to handle the recentness of the products to be able to follow the ever-changing trends.

        Including the amount of item interactions mapped together with the lifespan of the items is the next figure up, to better see how the lifespan of the items change with the amount of item interactions on them.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=5in]{image/avglifetimeoncount.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Average life time of products grouped on event count}
    \label{figure:averageLifetimBasedoncount}
    \end{figure}
        This figure shows the life span of the products grouped and sorted on the number of interactions on the items.
        The life span of an item is the time from the first event on the item till the last event on the item.
        The red line is the regression line of the average life spans at the different interactions counts.
        The gap between 117 to 160 is because no items have an interaction count of that amount.

        As we can see from the regression line, the average life span of an item increases with the count of item interactions, which is somewhat expected since they are in many ways intertwined, but there are indications of a reduction of interest with time, which advocates the idea that recentness is important.

        The figure above averaged the lifespan of the items and presented them with together with their respective count, the next figure keeps them separate, to not lose the lifespan distribution.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=5in]{image/itemTimeSpansortedoneventcount.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Life time of items mapped with event count}
    \label{figure:itemTimeSpanEventCount}
    \end{figure}
        This figure shows the total life span of each item mapped together with the amount of events triggered on them.
        As mentioned earlier, the life span of an item is the time since the first event on the item till the last event on the item.
        This figure is showing the same data as in figure~\ref{figure:averageLifetimBasedoncount}, but instead of taking the average life span at the give product interactions count, the products are mapped separately, to show the diversity in life span given the different product interaction counts.

        Time is shown in weeks, so the longest time span of an item is about 27 weeks, which is close to the time span of the events gathered from SoBazaar.
        Even though an item has a long time span does not mean that the item has been of measurable interest to the users in the SoBazaar application, but we see that the more interaction on the item, the longer the average life time, but the recentness of an item is important.
        Even though some item has a lot of interaction, they item can have a quite low lifespan, which promotes the importance of looking into recentness.

        Next figures presents how long in average the user use before taking an action such as \emph{purchase} or \emph{want}.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\dualGraphWidth]{image/product_wanteddistribution.png}
            \caption{View times before wanting an item}
    \label{figure:viewWant}

    \label{figure:viewBuy}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Average view times of products before want or purchase}
    \end{figure}
        The figures above shows the average time of the users of the SoBazaar application before pressing either \emph{want} or \emph{purchase}.

        The average times between the two are quite similar, but we can see that the user is on average somewhat faster to press \emph{purchase}.
        The data set on \emph{product\_purchase\_intended} is considerably smaller than \emph{product\_wanted}, so the trends seen here are inconclusive at best.

        The figures above presented the actions \emph{purchase} and \emph{want}, the next figure presents the \emph{bounce rate}, or in other words, how fast the user on average triggered a non related event to the item currently being watched.
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=5in]{image/product_detail_clickeddistribution.png}
        \centering
        \caption{View times before leaving an item (Bounce Rate)}
    \label{figure:bounceRate}
    \end{figure}
        This figure shows the time the users use before not taking any more action towards the item (\emph{purchase} or \emph{want}).
        The majority of the users have a view time of less than 6 seconds before they moves on to another item.

        When comparing this figure with figure~\ref{figure:viewWant} and figure~\ref{figure:viewBuy} we see a more definite difference.
        The users are much faster to look at a new item when not pressing \emph{want} or \emph{purchase}.
        This could indicate a disinterest towards the item.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=5in]{image/eventsPerDay.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Distribution of events per day}
    \label{figure:eventOnDaysDist}
    \end{figure}
        This figure shows the event distribution per day over the time period the events were stored.
        The spikes we see happens on a weekly basis, and is centered around the weekends, which is natural since this is an entertainment applications.
        The larger spike from the start of January to the start of March and end of April to the end of May might be due to increase in publicity or other outside factors.

   \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=5in]{image/hrdistribution.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Events at time of day}
    \label{figure:timeOfDayDistr}
    \end{figure}
        The figure above presents the amount of events during the given hours.

        One interesting discovery from this figure is the shape. One might have expected the application usage to have a sinus wave shape, but it has instead an increase in usage around 22 o'clock, which support the claim done based on figure~\ref{figure:eventOnDaysDist}, that SoBazaar is an entertainment application.

\subsection{Discussion}
    The repetitive pattern though out the preceding subsections is that the data is sparse, with low life span of user accounts and items, which is no surprise since the application as a product is in such an early stage.
    This sparsity must be handled to be able to make good recommendations, since it is so central when it comes to making predictions.

    Throughout the data exploration section we also saw that time plays a central role, in context of life span and the users and the items.
    The time an item lives varies greatly, but over one third of the items are active for no more than 1 week, which makes it important to consider how new an item is when making predictions.


\section{Conversion Rate Properties}
\label{sec:conv-rate}

In many domains the number of activities on an item given a specific user
implies preference. The activity in question may be the number of plays in a
music service~\cite{parra2011walk} or the amount of minutes used watching a
specific TV-show~\cite{study-on-implicit-tv}. We want to validate this
hypothesis in the SoBazaar data, determining if the \textit{number of clicks}
on an item implies higher preference, that is an higher probability of buying
the item.

If the hypothesis holds true, we can use this fact in order improve
classification of our models in future sections. In addition we can customize
the user interface so that if a user has clicked the item, we should with a
higher frequency show the item to the user --- as he/she is more probable of
buying it once seen in detail.

In order to validate the hypothesis we iterate through all users and look at
their respective events, summarizing the number of times the user has clicked
an item $n$ times and of these how many times the user also bought it. We do
this for all values of $n$, where $n \in [1,6]$ and obtain the following table
of conversion rates and standard errors.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lllll}
    \toprule
    N & Clicks & Purchases & Rate & Standard Error \\
    \midrule
    1 & 15602 & 1039  & 0.0667 & 0.20\% \\
    2 & 2672  & 323   & 0.1208 & 0.63\% \\
    3 & 433   & 84    & 0.1939 & 1.89\% \\
    4 & 173   & 36    & 0.2081 & 3.10\% \\
    5 & 65    & 19    & 0.2923 & 5.63\% \\
    6 & 54    & 20    & 0.3703 & 6.57\% \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:prob-purchase}
  \caption{Probabilties of purchase, given $N$ visits on item}
\end{table}

The standard error gives a useful indication on how certain we can be that the
results are statistically significant, and is calculated based on the sample
size (number of clicks) and the amount of conversions. Given the rate as $r$
and sample size as $S$ we calculate the standard error $e$ as:

\begin{equation}
  e = \sqrt{\frac{r(1 - r)}{S}}
\end{equation}

Using the standard error we want to perform an hypothesis test determining if
the results are significant within our accepted confidence of 95\%. In other
words we want to be 95\% sure that the patterns found in the data are not just
random. Our two hypothesis which we want to test are thus:

$\mathbf{H_0:}$ The differences in conversion rates between our first
(baseline) and second scenario is random.

$\mathbf{H_1:}$ The difference is significant, such that one scenario have a
higher probability of conversion.

and we want to do multiple tests when $n \in [2,6[$, using $n-1$ as baseline
and $n$ as the second scenario. For each test we calculate the
\textit{P-value}, which is the probability of obtaining a result at least as
extreme as the one that was actually observed. When the P-value becomes less
that our predetermined significance level ($0.05$ when we do a 95\%
significance test) we can reject our null-hypothesis, which is what we want to
do. In order to find this P-value we use the Standard Score, also called the
\textit{Z-score}, which is the number of standard deviations an observation is
above the mean. As we have two samples we can calculate the difference in
conversion rates and use the cumulated standard error in order to find the
Z-score:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq-z-score}
  Z = \frac{r_b - r_v}{\sqrt{e_{b}^{2} + e_{v}^{2}}}
\end{equation}

where $r_b$ and $r_v$ are the conversion rates for the baseline and second
scenario respecivly. $e_b$ and $e_v$ are equally the standard errors for the
two scenarios. Using standard normal deviate (normallly distributed random
variable with expected value 0 ($s$) and standard deviation 1 ($h$)) we can
find the cumulative probability for validity of the model - the P-value.

We calculate the P-value using $n=1$ as baseline and $n=2$ as our second
scenario. The Z-score is calculated by Equation~\ref{eq-z-score} and we obtain
our result:

\begin{equation}
  Z = \frac{0.0667-0.1208}{\sqrt{0.0020^2 + 0.0063^2}} = \frac{-0.05}{\sqrt{0.4369}} = -8.1848
\end{equation}

This is a very low Z-score, and when we are this many standard deviations away
from the mean in a standard normal deviate the P-value or area under the curve
is approximated to 0. This is a value lower than our predetermined significance
level ($0.05$) and thus we can reject the null-hypothesis and state with
statistical accuracy and correctness that there is a higher probability of
buying the item given that the user has clicked on the item twice, rather than
having clicked on the item only once. In our first scenarios we have sufficient
data to come to this conclusion, however, when comparing later scenarios we see
that our numbers stop being significant as a result of the dataset being too
small.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lllll}
  \toprule
  Baseline & Alternative & Z-score & P-value & Significant \\
  \midrule
  1 & 2 & -8.1848 & 0.0000 & \cmark \\
  2 & 3 & -3.6516 & 0.0001 & \cmark \\
  3 & 4 & -0.3889 & 0.3487 & \xmark \\
  4 & 5 & -1.3096 & 0.0952 & \xmark \\
  5 & 6 & -0.9013 & 0.1837 & \xmark \\
  \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Our conclusion is then that when a user has clicked on an item two times there
is a higher probability of buying it compared to when the user has only
clicked it once. This is also true when the user has clicked an item three
times, but we can not defend it statistically for any higher value of clicks.

        \label{figure:minStatesInteractions}
    \end{figure}
        The figure above presents the events as states and shows the interactions between them.
        The weights on the edges between the states are the count of state changes from the sending state to the receiving state.
        As we can see from the figure, states can access themselves.
        This figure is a minimized view to better present the state interactions regarding products, where states such as \emph{activity\_clicked}, \emph{around\_me\_clicked} and \emph{stores\_map\_clicked}, have been left out to give focus to item interaction related states.
        For a more complete view without reduced states see~\ref{figure:statesInteractions}.

        The \emph{Init}-state is the initialization of the application, which leads to the \emph{Start}-state, which is a reduction of the variations of events which indicates that a session is started, such as \emph{user\_logged\_in}, \emph{app\_started} and \emph{app\_first\_started}.
        From this most of the users enter the \emph{store\_accessed}-state, which is the shared state of all the store related states.
        As we can see from the figure, in 12 477 cases the users enters a store after already having entered a store, which means that the user did not access any of the items in the first entered store, and we see that this is a common way of browsing the products in the application. Since this leaves little indication about the user preferences, other ways of gathering this must be utilized.
        While this thesis was being written additional events was added, one of these was \emph{content:interact:item\_scroll}, which has proven to be of good help to derive user preferences~\cite{Claypool01inferringuser}.

        If we focus on the states \emph{product\_wanted} and \emph{product\_purchase\_intended}, we see that 160 occurrences of being in the \emph{product\_wanted}-state progressed into the \emph{product\_purchase\_intended}-state.

%     Init Hypothesis:

%     Must make different rules for the different stores:
%     "Bik Bok", "Cubus", "Gina Trik", "H\&M", "Bianco" has a broad specter of extra
%     functions inside the web store, whereas others might not, only shows the
%     product and a add to chart button.  This might divide the use pattern of the
%     users into a:

%     "product\_detail\_clicked" $\Rightarrow$ "product\_purchase\_intended" $\Rightarrow$ "product\_wanted"

%     "product\_detail\_clicked" $\Rightarrow$ "product\_purchase\_intended" $\notimplies$ "product\_wanted",

%     and

%     "product\_detail\_clicked" $\Rightarrow$ "product\_wanted"

%     based on the store accessed.

%     Use this to make a "rule set" with a probability.
%     Then again use this to recommend items for the users with that given
%     probability.

%     Find a "most popular session"-pattern
%     Find a "most likely to come after"-pattern
