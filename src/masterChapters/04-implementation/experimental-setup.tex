\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Parameter Settings}

For ALS-WR we found the following parameters to give us the best results after performing cross-validation.
latent features = $100$, $\lambda$ = $100-150$, number of iterations = $10-15$, implicit feedback = true, alpha = $10$.
However, there are probably still room for improvements as we did not perform an \emph{exhaustive} grid-search.
All experiments was run with the following settings: latent features = $100$, $\lambda$ = $100$, number of iterations = $15$,
implicit feedback = true and alpha = $10$.
