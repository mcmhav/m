\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Computer Specifications}

The experiments are run on a Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit
machine with an Intel Core i7 920 CPU and 12GB of ram.

\subsection{Parameter Settings}

%Parameter settings for our fancy algorithms

In k-NN item-item models, the number of neighbors 
generally increases system performance (Bell et al., 2007a, 2007b). However, the quadratic 
complexity of the search for k-NN, whether in time or space, is quadratic. So there's always a 
tradeoff for an industrial system \cite{Deshpande2004, Cremonesi2010} to select a 
reasonable value for K. We experimented with different values of neighbors and found that a K
value between 80-200 generally produced the best results.

For ALS-WR we found the following parameters to give us the best results after performing cross-validation.
latent features = $100$, $\lambda$ = $100\-150$, number of iterations = $10\-15$, implicit feedback = true, alpha = $10$.
However, there are probably still room for improvements as we did not perform an \emph{exhaustive} grid-search.
All experiments was run with the following settings: latent features = $100$, $\lambda$ = $100$, number of iterations = $15$,
implicit feedback = true and alpha = $10$.
