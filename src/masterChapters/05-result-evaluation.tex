\section{Discussion}

In Chapter 1 we introduced a total of 8 goals for our Master's thesis:

\begin{itemize}
\item G1: Gain a better understanding of the fashion domain.
\item G2: Identify the specific challenges of making fashion recommendations.
\item G3: Study how existing technologies can be adapted to mitigate or
  		  overcome these challenges.
\item G4: Study existing solutions to the cold-start.
\item G5: Identify the best suited methods with regard to both application and domain.
\item G6: Explore the existing solutions of how to infer user preference from implicit feedback data.
\item G7: Establish user interaction patterns to support our assumptions.
\item G8: Find different methods of combining various event types into implicit ratings.
\item G9: Find metrics in order to evaluate the \emph{implicit ratings}
\end{itemize}

In the following subsection we will reiterate these goals and discuss whether we have succeeded in reaching our goals. Readers should
note that we already have performed a detailed analysis of the results of the work on goals G1 in Section \ref{sec:dataset-conclusion},
G2 in Section \ref{}, G3 in Section \ref{}, G4 and G5 in Section \ref{sec:cold-start-discussion}, G6 in Section \ref{implicit-weaknesses},
G7 in Section \ref{}, G8 in Section \ref{} and finally G9 in Section \ref{sec:evaluation-metrics}.
The following discussion will therefore be fairly high-level, and avoid the \emph{nitty-gritty} details.

\subsection{G1, G2 and G3: Solutions to the fashion domain related problems}
\label{sec:fashion-discussion}

Through thorough examination and analysis of the data and a literature review of fashion articles we came to the following main conclusions: sparse data should be supplemented with other data to improve results and the variety of ways to do so, time is central and fashion is built on subcultures.

After analyzing the data it became apparent that the data was not just sparse in the sense of users, but also in the sense of items and item interactions.
The sparsity of the data
    Few users
    Few interactions on items
    Few purchases per user
        Naturally more clicks and wants
            Higher rate of purchases based on more clicks
                Can and should use this to supplement the low purchase data with click and want data

Time
    Many user accounts are shortlived
    Many items are shortlived
        Must handle items as decaying entities
            Recommendations must be supplemented with the recentness of the data

Fashion
    Fashion not only to wear something - Fashion for showing off
        Expect to find evidence of user preferences in content data
    Beloning to a subculture
        Expect to find user preferences in user demographics


%TODO - Dicuss data findings

%Important notes

\subsection{G4: The Cold-Start Problem}
\label{sec:cold-start-discussion}

Through our literature review, we closely examined five different classes of solutions to the cold-start problem. Namely trust-aware recommender system, filterbots, seed users, interview process and hybrid methods.

However, a question that should be asked is whether there exists and solutions which we did not discover or was excluded from our review. An issue that could have influenced the results of our review is \emph{researchers bias}, which could have arisen of any of the researchers had preferences for one of the solution types before the literature search. The reason for including multiple methods that never were used was due to uncertainty regarding what data would become available during the project. Trust-aware recommender system and hybrid methods in particular could never be tested out due to a lack of social/demographic data, which we were hoping to get access to.



After closely examining the different methods we concluded that both filterbots and content-boosted hybrid methods could provide a possible solution for
our specific scenario...

Demographic information could further improve its performance and usefulness. Agarwal et. al. \cite{Agarwal2009} used 13 filterbots in their experiments, where 11 out of 13 bots rated items based on demographic information.


\subsection{G5, G6, G7: Implicit Ratings}
\label{sec:implicit-discussion}

Importance of implicit factors for the domain

Another question that arises is: when does it become obsolete to look at clicks and wants?

%TODO - Discuss implicit ratings





\section{Issues}\label{sec:issues}

%TODO - Mention that the recommender system libraries are terribad for evaluation...
