As previously mentioned in the evaluation section the main reasons for implementing a recommender
system is the desire to improve user satisfaction and to increase the economic success of a platform.
We believe it would be interesting to look into how one could implement a reward attribute for the
items, that factors in how much Telenor will profit from its sale.

\begin{equation}
Expected return_i = P(Sale_i) * Reward(i)
\end{equation}


The question then, is how this information can e.g. be used/incorporated into the recommender to
increase profits while without sacrificing user satisfaction.
