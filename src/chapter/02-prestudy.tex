\section{Data Findings}
\subsection{What Can Be Understood From The Data}
\subsubsection{The Expected}
Event "app_started"; all have user_id's
Event "app_first_started"; all user_id's are NULL
Event "user_logged_in"; all have user_id's... (assigned with login, event saved after login?)

\subsubsection{The Strange}
NULL valued events: (Not all strange, but put together for readability)
facebook_share_changed
collection_viewed
wantlist_menu_entry_clicked
app_became_active

app_first_started
facebook_login_failed

> db.prod.distinct('event_json.ipAddress').length
9033
> db.prod.distinct('event_json.eventData.device_id').length
2644
> db.prod.distinct('user_id').length
1660

More devices than users, can't fill the blanks with device_id
