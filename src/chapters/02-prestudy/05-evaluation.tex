Some key questions in evaluating recommender systems on testbed data are: what
to predict, how to grade performance and what baseline to compare with.

%Implicit feedback classfication (Type, confidence, precision)

In the case of our project we collect the following data, which can be
considered as implicit feedback.  - product\_detail\_clicked,
product\_purchase\_intended, collection\_viewed(?)...

Other types of implicit feedback include purchase history, browsing
history, search pattern and even mouse movements

Accuracy metrics not suited for implicit feedback datasets, as they require
knowing which items are undesired by a user \cite{Hu2008}.

Being accurate is not always enough. Striking a balance between accuracy and
user satisfaction \cite{McNee2006}
  % High accuracy != User satisfaction
  % Therefore, important to consider other evaluation metrics beyond the
  % conventional ones Which are the most important factors to consider with
  % regards to user satisfaction

The data available strongly influences the choice of evaluation method/metrics.
E.g. classification accuracy metrics seem to be the most suitable when working
with binary preferences, e.g. in the form of recall-oriented measures.
