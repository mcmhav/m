%Our experiment aims to uncover...


\section{Selecting datasets for evaluation}

In addition to evaluate the methods on the Sobazar dataset we want to make sure that our solution generalizes beyond our experimental dataset, in accordance to the general guidelines for experimental studies \ref{Shani2011}.

Most public datasets contain explicit feedback

Lack of public datasets containing user browsing history, purchases...

How to select datasets:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Size of dataset: Preferable as close as possible to Sobazar (in 6 months)
	\item Type of user feedback:
	\item Domain: E-commerce datasets with purchase history would be most relevant.
	\item Precence of features: To evaluate hybrid methods?
\end{itemize} 


%Most datasets contain explicit feedback
%Size which is close to what we imagine the final system


\subsection{Dataset 1}

Rossmann dataset?
%General statistics and averages
%Interesting findings/properties
%Was cleaning neccesary?
%How was the methods evaluated on the dataset?
%	- x-fold cross validation


\subsection{Dataset 2}

Movielens/Million Song dataset?
%General statistics and averages
%Interesting findings/properties
%Was cleaning neccesary?
%How was the methods evaluated on the dataset?
%	- x-fold cross validation



\subsection{Sobazar Data}

%Highlight limitations of the sobazar dataset for evaluation
%Number of users
%Number of items
%Number of ratings
%-> Implications for evaluation
%How was the methods evaluated on the dataset?
%	- x-fold cross validation

\subsection{Summary}

%Some fancy tables n stuff

%TODO - What else is interesting to know? Rating scale, average number of ratings per user, number of cold start users...
