\section{Selecting datasets for evaluation}

In addition to evaluate the methods on the Sobazar dataset we want to make sure that our solution generalizes beyond our experimental dataset, in accordance to the general guidelines for experimental studies \ref{Shani2011}.

Most public datasets contain explicit feedback

How to select datasets:
\begin{itemize}
\item Size of dataset:
\item Domain:
\item Precence of features
\end{itemize} 


%Most datasets contain explicit feedback
%Size which is close to what we imagine the final system
%E-commerce datasets with purchase history would be the most relevant...
