\section{Generating implicit ratings}

As discussed in Section~\ref{} we can generate ratings based on observed
user behaviours in order to create a better experience for the users, by not
asking them to explicitly rate items, and we utilize valuable information often
found in access-logs and so forth. Hence, by having robust methods for
generating (implicit) ratings based on these logs we can create common
recommender systems models and recommend items without the user activly taking
part of the process.

\subsection{Levels of frequency, with global popularity}

Considering the weaknesses presented in Section~\ref{levels-frequency}, namely
chosing good weights and only using a small percentage of the scale between
0\-100. Further, the method presented does not differentiate between active and
less active users, thus ignoring the entropy once the maximal level is reached.
Instead we extend the method by considering the global popularity of each item,
so that the user that as clicked
