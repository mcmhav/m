\section{Generating implicit ratings}

As discussed in Section~\ref{} we can generate ratings based on observed
user behaviours in order to create a better experience for the users, by not
asking them to explicitly rate items, and we utilize valuable information often
found in access-logs and so forth. Hence, by having robust methods for
generating (implicit) ratings based on these logs we can create common
recommender systems models and recommend items without the user activly taking
part of the process.
